🎨 Neural Style Transfer
Task-05 | Prodigy InfoTech Generative AI Internship
🌟 What this project is about

Ever wondered how AI can turn a normal photo into a painting-style image?
That’s exactly what this project does ✨

In this task, I implemented Neural Style Transfer, where:

One image provides the content (what’s in the image)

Another image provides the style (artistic patterns, colors, textures)

A deep learning model blends both into a brand-new artistic image

This project was completed as Task-05 during my Generative AI Internship at Prodigy InfoTech.

🧠 How it actually works (in simple words)

A pre-trained VGG19 neural network looks at both images

The model learns:

What the image shows (content)

How the image looks (style)

Using optimization, the model slowly updates a new image

After multiple steps, the image looks artistic 🎨

Yes, it felt magical when it finally worked 😄

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Python

PyTorch

TorchVision

VGG19 (pre-trained CNN)

Google Colab (GPU)

PIL & Matplotlib

▶️ How to run the project

Open the notebook in Google Colab

Enable GPU
Runtime → Change runtime type → GPU

Upload the content and style images

Run all the cells step-by-step

Get your AI-generated artistic image 🎉

🖼️ Output

The final image:

Keeps the structure of the content image

Applies the art style from the style image

Looks different every time you try (that’s the fun part!)

📚 What I learned

How CNNs extract features from images

Difference between content loss and style loss

Practical use of VGG19

Debugging PyTorch errors (patience level unlocked 😅)

Hands-on experience with Generative AI concepts
